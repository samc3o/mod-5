The body structure is simple:
One div tag, the 'outer container' that contains:
	3 div tags each acting as a singleton container containing one section that was required in the assignment.
That is, 3 sections, that take up space according to the viewing device.
Dummy text was used.

				<h2>Narrow AI</h2>
				<p>
					Artificial narrow intelligence (ANI), also referred to as weak AI or narrow AI, is the only type of artificial intelligence we have successfully realized to date. Narrow AI is goal-oriented, designed to perform singular tasks - i.e. facial recognition, speech recognition/voice assistants, driving a car, or searching the internet - and is very intelligent at completing the specific task it is programmed to do.

				<h2>General AI</h2>
				<p>
					Artificial general intelligence (AGI), also referred to as general AI or 'strong' AI, is the concept of a machine with general intelligence that mimics human intelligence and/or behaviours, with the ability to learn and apply its intelligence to solve any problem. AGI can think, understand, and act in a way that is indistinguishable from that of a human in any given situation. We haven't got any of those around yet.

			<section class = "col-3">
				<h2>Sentient AI</h2>
				<p>
					Artificial super intelligence (ASI), is the hypothetical AI that doesn't just mimic or understand human intelligence and behaviour; ASI is where machines become self-aware and surpass the capacity of human intelligence and ability. Yes, this is the stuff of fiction and equals religion in it's degree of hypotheticality. Once a few of these are around, it's all quits for us. Hopefully, we won't live long enough to see that
